        <div class="box3"><p>As the population starts to increase more and more, our thirst for water will also increase. Many different places have anticipated that there will be water shortages by 2024. Conserving water can help the water last longer so we don't have any water shortages. Water conservation is the practice of efficiently preserving, controlling, and managing water resources. Water is one of the most important natural resources that all living things need. Water is a basic demand for all food. Water is vital to grow fruit, vegetables, and all livestock consume it. Conserving water helps save energy. Energy is important because it helps filter, heat, and pump water to your home. Also, conserving water will help save your money. If you use less water, then your water bill will also be lower.
